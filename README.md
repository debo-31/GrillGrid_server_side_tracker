# GrillGrid_server_side_tracker
GrillGrid is an innovative system for tracking and resolving deadlocks in resource-intensive environments. It uses advanced algorithms such as the Banker’s Algorithm, Resource Allocation Graph (RAG), and scheduling methods like First Come First Serve (FCFS) and First In First Out (FIFO) to optimize resource allocation and order processing.
Designed for multitasking systems, GrillGrid ensures smooth operations in environments like restaurant management, production lines, and any setup involving concurrent resource access. It prevents deadlocks by evaluating resource requests dynamically using the Banker’s Algorithm and detects potential issues through RAG analysis. Scheduling techniques like FCFS and FIFO enhance order management by maintaining fairness and minimizing delays.

GrillGrid delivers real-time tracking, efficient resource management, and ensures scalability, making it an ideal solution for modern, resource-intensive systems.
The system is designed to address the challenges faced in multitasking environments where multiple processes compete for limited resources. Banker’s Algorithm proactively avoids unsafe states by dynamically evaluating resource requests against available resources. RAG provides a visual and analytical approach to identifying potential deadlocks by mapping resource allocation and detecting cycles, which signal deadlock conditions.

For scheduling, FCFS processes requests in the order of arrival, ensuring fairness and predictability, while FIFO simplifies queue management, making it ideal for sequential resource distribution. These methods ensure that GrillGrid maintains efficient and conflict-free resource allocation.

GrillGrid’s capabilities make it suitable for diverse applications:

Restaurant Management: Handles concurrent resource demands like kitchen appliances and utensils during peak times.
Production Lines: Prevents bottlenecks in machinery and tool usage in manufacturing.
IT Systems: Manages shared resources like databases in distributed systems.
The system is designed for scalability, accommodating dynamic workloads, and ensuring real-time tracking and resolution of resource conflicts. GrillGrid includes visualization tools for monitoring resource allocation, enabling users to analyze and optimize system performance effectively.

By integrating proactive deadlock prevention, real-time detection, and efficient scheduling, GrillGrid delivers a robust solution for modern resource-intensive environments.
