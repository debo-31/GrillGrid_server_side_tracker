# Smart Kitchen Resource Management System

A comprehensive kitchen resource management application that prevents deadlocks in kitchen operations by applying the Banker's Algorithm from operating systems theory.

## Project Overview

The Smart Kitchen Resource Management System is designed to optimize kitchen operations by efficiently managing the allocation of kitchen equipment among staff members. In a busy kitchen environment, multiple chefs and kitchen staff need to share limited equipment resources like ovens, stoves, and cutting boards. Without proper management, this can lead to deadlocks - situations where staff members are waiting indefinitely for equipment that others won't release.

This system applies the Banker's Algorithm (a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm) to kitchen operations, ensuring that equipment is allocated in a way that prevents deadlocks and maximizes efficiency.

## Features

### Kitchen Theme Integration
- Kitchen staff (chefs, sous-chefs, etc.) are modeled as processes
- Kitchen equipment (ovens, knives, cutting boards) are modeled as resources
- Food preparation tasks are visualized to represent processes

### Enhanced Visualization
- Interactive kitchen layout display showing staff and equipment
- Animated resource allocation flow diagram
- Step-by-step execution visualization showing how resources move between staff
- Color-coding to highlight safe and unsafe states

### Practical Simulation
- Real-world kitchen scenarios as presets (small kitchen, busy restaurant, etc.)
- Kitchen workflow simulation showing how staff use equipment over time
- Deadlock demonstration to show how kitchen operations can grind to a halt

### Additional Features
- Resource request handling interface
- Deadlock detection module
- Multiple algorithm comparison (Banker's, FIFO, Priority-based)
- Save/load system configurations

### Technical Features
- Modular architecture with separate core, UI, and data components
- Unit tests to ensure algorithm correctness
- Detailed documentation explaining the theoretical concepts
- Real-world kitchen applications

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Tkinter (usually included with Python)

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-kitchen.git
   cd smart-kitchen
   ```

2. Run the application:
   ```
   python smart_kitchen_app.py
   ```

## Usage Guide

### Main Screen
The main screen consists of several tabs:

1. **Kitchen Management**: The primary interface for managing kitchen resources
   - Select a kitchen scenario from the dropdown
   - View staff and equipment resources
   - Request or release equipment for specific staff members
   - Check if the current state is safe
   - View visualizations of resource allocation

2. **Kitchen Simulation**: Run simulations of kitchen workflows
   - Watch kitchen operations unfold over time
   - See how resources are allocated and released
   - Experiment with different scenarios and modes

3. **Algorithm Comparison**: Compare different resource allocation strategies
   - Banker's Algorithm (deadlock prevention)
   - FIFO (First-In-First-Out)
   - Priority-based allocation

4. **Help & Documentation**: Learn about the system
   - Overview of kitchen resource management
   - Theoretical background on Banker's Algorithm
   - Usage instructions

### Getting Started
1. Choose a kitchen scenario from the dropdown menu
2. Observe the initial resource allocation
3. Try requesting additional resources for staff members
4. Check if the resulting state is safe
5. Run a simulation to see kitchen operations in action

## Theory: Banker's Algorithm in Kitchen Context

The Banker's Algorithm, originally developed by Edsger Dijkstra, is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm. In our kitchen adaptation:

- **Available Resources**: Represents the equipment currently not being used by any staff member
- **Maximum Need**: The maximum amount of each equipment type a staff member might need
- **Allocated Resources**: Equipment currently being used by each staff member
- **Need Matrix**: Equipment still needed by each staff member (Maximum - Allocated)

The algorithm works by:
1. Checking if a resource request can be granted without risking deadlock
2. Ensuring the system remains in a "safe state" where all staff can eventually complete their tasks
3. Finding a "safe sequence" in which staff members can execute their tasks without deadlock

## Real-World Applications

This system can be used in:
1. **Restaurant Kitchens**: Optimize equipment usage in busy restaurant kitchens
2. **Culinary Schools**: Teach resource management principles to culinary students
3. **Food Production Facilities**: Manage shared equipment in industrial food production
4. **Catering Operations**: Coordinate equipment usage across multiple catering events
